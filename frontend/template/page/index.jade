                p
                    | My first experience at building outsource team was in 2004. I have founded a company
                    | in Togliatti, Russia focused at Web Development. Unlike most outsourcing companies we have
                    | focused our efforts around different goals:

                ul
                    li Focus at hiring a best software professionals at reasonable cost.
                    li Always working on the project based on Quotation rather than hourly cost.
                    li Develop internal platform, then using it to speed up development speed and increase competitiveness.
                    li Keep work interesting by focusing on most challenging and risky projects.

                p
                    | Experience of the past 10 years has transformed into my current stable business:
                    | <a href="http://agile55.com" target="_blank">Agile55.com</a>.
                p
                    | Agile55 team has often stepped in and participated in the RFQ (Request for Quotations)
                    | I have planning out for my clients with a great success and perfect delivery record.
                    | At the same time I am still involved in Agile55 as a consultant and coach which helped
                    | us very often to get project implemented faster and smoother.

                p
                    | I honestly believe in the good nature of OpenSource movement and that it can have
                    | a great impact on our well-being. I myself have contributed tens of thousands of
                    | lines of source code.

                    | <a href="http://agiletoolkit.org/about/authors" target="_blank">Agile Toolkit</a> is one of my greatest achievements - the most popular PHP Web UI Framework
                    | in the world. I have been putting a lot of extra work to translate my OpenSource project
                    | into a working business model with a well-sustained growth and support.

                ul
                    li Focus on giving service and software for free for Personal and OpenSource projects
                    li Offer a great experience to businesses and professionals.
                    li Focus on educating and improving Web Developers overall as our higher goals.
                    li Redefine and reinvent. Simplify and make coding more fun to learn.

                    | Soon I am planning to release the most significant improvement to Agile Toolkit ever,
                    | version 4.3 and an entirely new "Build and Deploy" platform.
