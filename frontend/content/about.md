# About Me

Hi, I'm Romans Malinovskis - a 36 year old Web Developer and Software Architect
from London. In 2003 I have built a web framework and after 2 years I have started a
service company to build web apps using my framework. Within the next 10 years I kept
refining my framework by taking it through 4 major rewrites until it was publicly
released in 2013.

Followed by a feedback from the initial 30,000+ downloads I started working
on creating support architecture around the framework itself - hosting platform,
educational program and enterprise support services.

In 2016 me and my team has finally deployed our initial partnership with several
Universities and Institutes in India - "ATK School". We anticipate to reach
over 2,000 students in the first year. Our goal is to teach the essentials of
web development during 80 hour course(s).

Through some key partnerships in UK I continue to work on connecting our growing
ATK developer group with enterprises and start-ups.

## Hobbies and Travel

It's quite difficult for me to relax from my lifetime passion (I'm writing this
text from skiing resourt), yet I try to take my mind off work and enjoy a
road cycling in Hertfordshire or visit new places.

Have an interesting idea or need my advice? <a href="{page}contact{/}">Get in touch</a>.

### Motivation

I live and work to empower developers. I believe that many development
paradigm, frameworks and libraries could have been easier to use. I strive
to apply "intuitive" and "easy-to-use" principles in the land of Web Apps.

### Start-ups

During my professional career I have helped many start-ups get off the
ground. What I've learned is deeply embedded into my teaching and framework -
it is the ability to create simple things quickly. Efficiency and out-of-the-box
experience is matter of life or death for start-ups.

### Agile in the Framework

Agile Methodology generated huge amount of momentum. I have applied the same
principles inside my framework and devised a whole educational program, which
focuses on making "agile" more safe and more efficient.
