# Blog

I publish blog articles every week mainly focusing on the challenges of practical
web application development.
If you have a question or challenge that you would like to write about on my blog - [contact me through my twitter - @romaninsh](https://twitter.com/romaninsh).

Traditionally CSS frameworks have relied on ability to combine multiple CSS classes for widget styling. While one class may specify the name of the widget (dropdown-menu), a supplimentary class (dropdown-menu-right) will define some property such as positioning of a menu:

``` html
<ul class="dropdown-menu dropdown-menu-right">
  ...
</ul>
```


Over the past few years I have worked with Agile CSS which relies very heavily on the concept of modifiers allowing your HTML code to specify size, alignment, paddings, selection of color palette and many other properties. Next example uses Agile CSS to style a `span` in a format of a green circle with a border:

``` html
<span "atk-shape-circle atk-swatch-green atk-padding-xsmall
    atk-text-baseline-reset atk-border-outline"></span>
```

The heavy focus on "modifiers" makes one of the unique points of [Agile CSS](http://css.agiletoolkit.org/) - ability to design entirely new widgets with very little additional CSS code and by focusing of re-usability. This approach have proven to be quite effectie at designing custom layouts, custom widgets and custom color schemes.

I know the author of Agile CSS pretty well and in the latest branch he has started using a new way of specifying CSS modifiers through *data-XX* attributes. This produces a cleaner HTML code and has also reduces size of your `style.css` file. Here is the HTML example which is using new style modifiers:

``` html
<span class="atk-swatch-green" data-shape="circle"
    data-padding="all-xs" data-text="baseline-reset"
    data-border="outline"></span>
```

    During the last few years I have migrated all my web applications from a classic LAMP server setup into Ubuntu running Dokku-alt PaaS manager. Despite some strong benefits there are very few articles/tutorials on how to configure and get your web apps running. This week I am writing about fundamental differences, benefits and challenges as you try out to build your own PaaS.
