                                p I deliver a high-quality work at all times focusing very much on creativity, efficiency and adding business value to your company. I am always for using a more efficient / cheaper strategy but I also try to maintain security, data consistency and stability as much as possible.

                                    li I provide my own equipment, office, network connection and pay for my travel expenses.
                                    li There are many services I offer - software strategic planning, developer hires, training, relations, server administration, software development, integration, sub-contracting, documentation and specification writing. Whichever you need - I can pretty much do it all. If you want me to help you set up Mail on your computer - I can do that too, although it still costs you #{rate}.
                                    li I do not take equity, profits or other benefits as a payment. It's all cash. I am also not responsible for the success of your business and any profits / losses are entirely yours.
                                    li Any hours I spend are final. I can't refund, offer warranties etc. This would require me to charge extra for risks, but I want my payment scheme to be transparent and easy to understand. The quality of the software I write from scratch are unarguably better then software developed by anyone else, so If i need to maintain 3rd party code - it's more time consuming and may result in more hours.

                                    li I track my work by hours. I am generally available 24/7 for emergencies at no extra cost.
                                    li I will try to respect time allocation or try and follow estimates as much as possible, but I always use "real" time spent.
                                    li My time is always backed by Time Tracer logs, Skype logs, Email dates, Git repository history or calendar meetings - which I call "evidence".
                                    li I charge for any project-related meeting, discussion and emails. I do not charge for general emails like this one.
                                    li You can pre-pay for my hours before I start work or pay after hours are delivered. However I cannot offer more than 20 hours on credit. Once I have 20 hours, I'll issue invoice immediately with a 7-day payment term. If the invoice is not paid in full within 7 days, I will stop my work unconditionally and will not be available for any emergency, meeting, consultancies and fixes.
                                    li I am always happy to provide any time tracking details, give a more detailed information about work done or provide extra estimates for the up-coming tasks, but any time I spend on this have to be counted as a project-related and billable hours.
                                    li If I fail to issue invoice on-time that's my own fault. Invoices have 7-day payment terms, and as long as I get paid at the earliest convenience, I can continue with my works and offer emergency services.
                                    li On some occasions - assuming we mutually agreed - I can pay a 3rd party supplier from my own company and invoice you the exact amount, this is not counted towards my hours.
