                  As a consultant who earns his salary as a freelancer, I dedicate my
                  time helping companies and individual like yourself on a part-time
                  basis. I deliver service of exceptional quality at affordable price,
                  but I need you to accept and respect my Terms of Service as outlined below.
                </p>
                <p>If you enjoy working with me, pass a word around and refer my services to others.</p>

              <div class="atk-wrapper">
                <h2>General Conditions</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>I provide my own equipment, office rent, network connection and pay for my travel expenses.</li>
                  <li>There are so many different things I can do: <b>software strategic planning, developer hires, training, relations, server administration, software development, integration, sub-contracting, documentation and specification writing</b>. If you want me to instead help me with your computer - I can do that too, although it will be billed under the same rate - <span class="atk-label atk-swatch-yellow">Â£50/h</span>.</li>
                  <li>I do not take equity, profits or other benefits as a payment. It's all cash. I am also not responsible for the success of your business and any profits / losses are entirely yours.</li>
                  <li>Any hours I spend are final. I can't refund or offer warranties etc. This would require me to charge extra for risks, but I want my payment scheme to be transparent and easy to understand.</li>
                  <li>If I start a new project, it will be much better quality than if I fix / change your existing project. If I have to work with 3rd party code - it's more time consuming and more difficult to estimate.</li>
                  <li>I rely on some advanced technology to complete my work - If you want someone junior to take over my work, they will require a lot of general training.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
                <ol>
                  <li>I have to allocate my time between multiple clients, and will work at different times. I do keep very firm track of my work hours. If you need me to be available within some time interval, this must be agreed in advance.</li>
                  <li>I will try to respect your time allocation requirements (e.g. spend 10h maximum) and try and follow estimates as close as possible, however I always use "actual" hours for billing.</li>
                  <li>My time is always backed by Evidence: Time Tracer logs, Chat logs, Email dates, Repository history or calendar meetings.</li>
                  <li>I charge for any project-related meeting, discussion and emails (including work on estimates). I do not charge for chit-chat, administrative stuff (invoices) or general discussions, but please do respect my time.</li>
                  <li>You can pre-pay my hours before I start work or pay after hours are delivered. I cannot offer more than <span class="atk-label atk-swatch-yellow">20</span> hours on credit. Once I run out of 20 hours, I'll issue invoice immediately with a 7-day payment term. </li>
                  <li>Invoices must be paid on time, otherwise I may have to prioritize other clients. I may not be able to respond to emergency tasks, meeting, consultations or prepare while your bill is not paid.</li>
                  <li>If I fail to issue invoice on-time that's my own fault. I would appreciate if you do send payment immediatelly. If necessary - set some money aside if in anticipation of my invoice.</li>
                  <li>On some occasions - assuming we mutually agreed - I can pay a 3rd party supplier. I will include the amount in my next invoice. This is not counted towards my hours.</li>
                </ol>
