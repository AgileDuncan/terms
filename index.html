                <p>
                  My first experience at building outsource team has been in 2004. I have founded a company
                  in Togliatti, Russia focused around Web Development. Unlike most outsource companies I have
                  focused my efforts around different goals:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Focus at hiring a best software professionals at reasonable cost.</li>
                  <li>Always working on the project based on Quotation rather than hourly cost.</li>
                  <li>Develop internal platform, then using it to speed up development speed and increase competetiveness.</li>
                  <li>Keep work interesting by focusing on most challenging and risky projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Experience of the past 10 years have transformed my efforts into a stable and
                  exciting business: <a href="http://agile55.com" target="_blank">Agile55.com</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The team has often stepped in and participated in the RFQ (Request for Quotations)
                  I have planning out for companies with a great success and perfect delivery record.
                  At the same time I am still involved in Agile55 as a consultant and coach which helped
                  us very often to get our web project implemented faster and smoother.

                <p>
                  I honestly believe in the good nature of OpenSource movement and that it can have
                  a great impact on our well-being. I myself have contributed tens of thousands of
                  lines of source code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <a href="http://agiletoolkit.org/about/authors" target="_blank">Agile Toolkit</a> is one of my greatest achievemetns - the most popular PHP Web UI Framework
                  in the world. I have been putting a lot of extra work to translate my OpenSource project
                  into a working business model with a well-sustained growth and support.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Focus on giving service and software for free for Personal and OpenSource projects</li>
                  <li>Offer a great experience to businesses and professionals.</li>
                  <li>Focus on educating and improving Web Developers overall as our higher goals.</li>
                  <li>Redefine and reinvent. Simplify and make coding more fun to learn.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Soon I am planning to release the most significant improvement to Agile Toolkit ever,
                  verison 4.3 and an entirely new "Build and Deploy" platform.
